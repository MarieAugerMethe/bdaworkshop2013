This is the data, the code and assorted files that were used in conjunction with a series of workshops on Bayesian Data Analysis given by myself for Dublin R over the summer/autumn of 2013.

All feedback and corrections are welcome, and feel free to make corrections yourself, if you need permissions to do so, just get in touch with me.
